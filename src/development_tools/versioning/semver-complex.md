## Parse a complex version string.

[![semver-badge]][semver] [![cat-config-badge]][cat-config]

Constructs a [`semver::Version`] from a complex version string using [`Version::parse`]. The string
contains pre-release and build metadata as defined in the [Semantic Versioning Specification].

Note that, in accordance with the Specification, build metadata is parsed and considered when
comparing versions. In other words, two versions are not equal even if their build strings differ.

```rust
{{#include examples/semver-complex.rs}}
